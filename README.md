### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share
systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City and
Washington.  I will write Python code to import the data and answer interesting
questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.  I will also write a script
that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to
present these statistics.

### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv

### What Software Do I Need?
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:
-  You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
-  A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
-  A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### The Datasets
In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider
for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City
and Washington, DC.  Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are
provided for all three cities.

All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
-  Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
-  End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
-  Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
-  Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
-  End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
-  User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
-  Gender
-  Birth Year

### Statistics Computed
In this project, I will write code to provide the following information:

1) Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
-  most common month
-  most common day of week
-  most common hour of day

2) Popular stations and trip
-  most common start station
-  most common end station
-  most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3) Trip duration
-  total travel time
-  average travel time

4) User info
-  counts of each user type
-  counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
-  earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
