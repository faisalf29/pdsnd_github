### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share
systems for three major cities in the United States â€” Chicago, New York City and
Washington.  I will write Python code to import the data and answer interesting
questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.  I will also write a script
that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to
present these statistics.

### Files used
